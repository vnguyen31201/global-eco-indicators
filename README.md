# Global Economic Indicators and Climate Impact on GDP

## Project Overview

This project investigates how global temperature trends affect the economic performance of countries over time, focusing on the relationship between climate change and GDP. Using public datasets from the World Bank and global climate sources, the project combines economic indicators with temperature data to uncover regional and temporal patterns.

The goal is to develop an interactive dashboard that enables users to explore GDP growth alongside environmental variables like temperature rise and CO₂ emissions.

## Objectives

* Clean and merge macroeconomic and climate datasets for over 100 countries
* Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and outliers
* Visualize trends in GDP, temperature, and emissions over time and by region
* Enable filtering by continent, income level, country, and time period
* Investigate correlations between temperature anomalies and economic growth

## Data Sources

* [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org)
* Country metadata for region/income group classification

## Tools and Technologies

* Power BI (data modeling and dashboard)
* Power Query (data cleaning and transformation)
* Excel (initial preprocessing and structure checks)
* DAX (for custom measures and time-based calculations)

## Key Metrics and Visuals

* Yearly GDP Growth by Country
* Interactive Map: Used to filter other visuals
* Correlation Charts: Temperature vs. GDP
* Country-level and regional comparison filters

## Report Pages

1. Global Overview – Summary KPIs, GDP vs. Temperature line charts
2. Country Insights – Detailed metrics for selected countries
3. Metadata - Information about the data used in the report

## Files Included

* `Global_Economic_Indicators.pbix` – Power BI file with the interactive report
* `Global_Economic_Indicators.pdf` – PDF summary of visuals and findings
* `README.md` – Project documentation

## Future Improvements

* Incorporate precipitation, sea level, and extreme weather event data
* Add insights per region
* Add regression models to quantify impact of temperature on GDP
* Publish interactive dashboard online using Power BI Service or embedded app
* Expand to include income inequality and labor productivity metrics
